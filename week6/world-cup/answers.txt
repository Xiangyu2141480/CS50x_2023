Questions:
Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The one which has 10 simulations.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 because it is fast enough and it is correct.
